# MQTT - Home-Assistant
Code for nodemcu/ESP8266 for controlling relay, lights and more in Home assitant environment

SimpleMqttRelay.ino is a simple control of a switch

FastLedPaletteSelection.ino is an example using WS2812b (aka NEOPIXEL) controlled by an input selection for changing palettes or using it as a simple RGB led strip. I also have a sensor (battery) communicating with home assistant that allow me to light a number of LEDs proportional to the value of Battery1 the way I can display on the led strip the value of the sensor.
